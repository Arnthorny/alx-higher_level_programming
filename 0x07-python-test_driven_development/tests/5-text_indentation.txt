Edward looked at his chart. Seven minutes. Im going to get you that hot lunch. Robert was nursing the plane along with all the skill at his command, using the throttle and rudder to try to keep it on a straight course. The altitude was still dropping alarmingly. Finally, ahead of him, Robert saw the sparkling blue waters of the Tonkin Gulf. Were home free, buddy, Robert said. Just a few more miles.""")		#doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +REPORT_UDIFF
